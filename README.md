# DSA-Basics-
**Basic projects going through data structures to help with learning foundations**

These projects are like building blocks to help learn foundational DS/A to prep for interviews. I was given a class structure template/skeleton for each and was told to go through each class and create the functions/ fill in what each class was supposed to accomplish/ do. I was also required to do testing and a walk-through for each to be able to assess where I needed help and where i got stuck.
